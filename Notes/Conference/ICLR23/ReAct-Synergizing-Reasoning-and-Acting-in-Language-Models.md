# ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models
2024-05-21
## Summary
ReAct combines reasoning and acting for solving problems. The method is to augment the agent's action space to $$A=A\cup L$$. L is the space of language. Compose few-shot ReAct-style exemplars, thought-action-observation steps, into the prompts. ReAct is able to retrieve information to support reasoning, while using reasoning to better retrieve text. This is a synergy of reasoning and acting.

## Evaluation
- Baseline:
	- standard prompting
	- CoT prompting (and CoT-SC, majority idea)
	- Acting-only prompt
- ReAct+CoT-SC: This illustrates the effect of combining the internal and external knowledge.
- Finetuning: Using the answers generated by ReAct to do finetuning has good results.

## Nice Sentences
> “This tight synergy between “acting” and “reasoning” allows humans to learn new tasks quickly and perform robust decision making or reasoning, even under previously unseen circumstances or facing information uncertainties.” (Yao 等, 2023, p. 1)

> “The best approach overall is a combination of ReAct and CoT that allows for the use of both internal knowledge and externally obtained information during reasoning.” (Yao 等, 2023, p. 3)

>“whereas CoT is more accurate in formulating reasoning structure but can easily suffer from hallucinated facts or thoughts.” (Yao 等, 2023, p. 5)

> “as the former essentially teaches models to memorize (potentially halluincated) knowledge facts, and the latter teaches models how to (reason and) act to access information from Wikipedia, a more generalizable skill for knowledge reasoning.” (Yao 等, 2023, p. 6)
